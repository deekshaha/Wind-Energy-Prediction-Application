* **This project has been developed as part of the IBM Hack Challenge 2020 by Team Seven**.

## Features 
* Predicts wind output from simple user inputs.
* Prediction can range from 1 hour to 72 hours.
* Recommends the wind farm admins the best time period for power generation.
* Visualize the power output using graphs.
* Compare the outputs for any two wind farm sites using "Compare" screen.
* Download the predicted power output in CSV format.
* Store the historical data in database to train the machine learning models. 
* Uses three important weather features to predict the power output.

## How to use it
* The application is deployed [here](https://node-red-seven.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/ui/#!/0?socketid=0rhfSrtrPdiOimYiAAAT).
* Follow the link and enter the input fields
* Click "Predict Power Output".
* This will generate the power prediction and display in form of a table as well as the graphs.
